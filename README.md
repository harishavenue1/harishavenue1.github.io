# Code Comparison Platform

A web-based platform for comparing algorithm implementations across multiple programming languages.

## Features

- **Multi-language Code Comparison**: View the same algorithm implemented in Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python side-by-side
- **40+ Algorithm Solutions**: Including data structures, dynamic programming, arrays, strings, and more
- **Testing Framework Cheatsheets**: Quick reference guides for Cypress, Selenium, Playwright, Docker, HTTP Status Codes, and Linux Commands
- **Interactive Interface**: Click any algorithm to see implementations across all languages

## Algorithms Included

- **Array Problems**: Two Sum, Contains Duplicate, Product Array, Max Profit
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Longest Common Subsequence
- **String Manipulation**: Palindrome, Valid Parentheses, Group Anagrams
- **Bit Manipulation**: Count Bits, Reverse Bits, Sum Without Add
- **Data Structures**: HashMap Operations, List Operations, Set Operations
- **Advanced**: Sliding Window Maximum, Kadane Algorithm, LRU Cache Design

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python server: `python3 server.py`
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
4. Click any algorithm button to compare implementations

## Project Structure
